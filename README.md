- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jarnagoose
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology and patterns as a form of artistic expression.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but I spend a lot of time working with PowerShell as a SharePoint/Teams/Power Platforms Administrator.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an art project involving timing and branching synced across multiple devices to build narrative structures amidst chaos.
- 📫 Find me online.
